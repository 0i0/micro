> Micro is a work in progress, not suitable for use yet.

Micro is a command line text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities
of modern terminals.

# Features

* Easy to use
* Common keybindings (ctrl-s, ctrl-c, ctrl-v, ctrl-z...)
* Extremely good mouse support
* True color support
* Cross platform
* Fast and efficient
* Syntax highlighting

Not all of this is implemented yet -- see [progress](#progress)

# Installation

Installation is simple. For now you must build from source, although in the future binaries will be provided.

```
go get -u github.com/zyedidia/micro
```

# Progress

Micro is very much a work in progress right now. To see what has and hasn't been done yet, see the [todolist](todolist.md)
